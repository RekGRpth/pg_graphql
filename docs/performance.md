To reproduce this result, start the demo described in the [quickstart guide](quickstart.md) and apache bench on a sample query.

i.e.

```shell
docker-compose up

echo '{"query": "{ accountCollection(first: 1) { edges { node { id } } } }", "variables": {}}' > query.json

ab -n 8000 -c 8 -T application/json -p query.json http://0.0.0.0:3000/rpc/graphql
```
