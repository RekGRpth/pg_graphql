Some GraphQL variables are not compatible with prepared statement
For example, the order by clause can be passed via a variable, but
SQL prepared statements can dynamically sort by column name or direction
based on a parameter.

This function returns a string that can be included in the cache key for
a query to ensure separate prepared statements for each e.g. column order + direction
and filtered column names

While false positives are possible, the cost of false positives is low
